The code posted folder in this field is used to test the MindFlex communication with the esp-32 and to see if the project is possible 

When it comes to finding and gathering data to see how the attention values correlate to me focusing on a task multiple tests were done.

The first test was my relaxing state to demonstrate which values show I'm relaxing. In this test, I had my eyes open and listened to music, and sometimes, I would close my eyes or tap my fingers or feet to the beat of the music.

The image above shows the attention value of 36-46 is my relaxed state and anything else would be noise. The cause of this noise could be due to during this test I was focusing to find a song, which might have led to numbers higher than 46.
