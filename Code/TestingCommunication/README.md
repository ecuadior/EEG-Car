The code here is a prototype of how the final project will look like.

Testing if 2 ESP-32 can communicate via ESP-NOW, in which the Master ESP-32 will read data from a IR sensor and the data would be sent to the Slave ESP-32.
The Slave ESP-32 would take the data from the Master ESP-32 and would use the input(0/1) to decide if the motor moves foward or stop.
