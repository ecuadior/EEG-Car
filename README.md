# EEG-Car
Project on a small car being controlled by ones brain wave 

UPDATES will be weekly/bi-weekly depends on school

  Currently working on the project I'll be posting the steps I've done to create this project. I'll use microcontrollers to read the brain wave and move the car. The plan is to create a PCB for the vehicle.
