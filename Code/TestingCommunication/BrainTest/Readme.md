The code posted folder in this field is used to test the MindFlex communication with the esp-32 and to see if the project is possible 

When it comes to finding and gathering data to see how the attention values correlate to me focusing on a task multiple tests were done.

The first test was my relaxing state to demonstrate which values show I'm relaxing. In this test, I had my eyes open and listened to music, and sometimes, I would close my eyes or tap my fingers or feet to the beat of the music.

The image above shows the attention value of 36-46 is my relaxed state and anything else would be noise. The cause of this noise could be due to during this test I was focusing to find a song, which might have led to numbers higher than 46. 

The next test involved me reading a book for around 30 minutes. When I read something interesting, all my focus goes into the book. To ensure I was concentrating, I wore noise-canceling headphones and listened to J-pop, which helps me focus. However, during the last 10 to 15 minutes, I lost focus, which caused a spike in values corresponding to my relaxed state.

Thus, there are two graphs belowâ€”one including the error and one without it. I believe the graph without the error is correct because the loss of focus likely began 10 to 15 minutes before the 30-minute mark.

Therefore, I believe attention values between 64 and 81 demonstrate that I'm focusing, or any number higher than 64, as I believe values above 81 also indicate focus.

Another test was conducted to observe my attention values while playing video games. For this test, I played Valorant for about an hour.
